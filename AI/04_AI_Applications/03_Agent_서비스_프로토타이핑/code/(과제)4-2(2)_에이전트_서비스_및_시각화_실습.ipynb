Agent 객체는 로딩 시간이 오래 걸릴 수 있으므로, 애플리케이션 실행 중 한 번만 로드되도록 Python 함수 내에서 캐싱하는 방법을 사용합니다.\n","\n","### 학습 키워드 설명\n","\n","*   **`Agent 기능 연동`**: 별도로 구현된 AI Agent의 핵심 로직(여기서는 `CustomerServiceAgent` 클래스의 인스턴스)을 다른 애플리케이션(여기서는 Gradio 웹 앱)에 통합하여 사용하는 과정입니다.\n","*   **`import`**: Python 모듈 시스템에서 다른 파일이나 패키지에 정의된 함수, 클래스, 변수 등을 현재 파일로 가져와 사용할 수 있게 하는 구문입니다. 이전 단계에서 작성한 Agent 코드를 `app.py`로 가져오는 데 사용합니다.\n","*   **`Python 함수 내 캐싱`**: Gradio 앱이 다시 로드될 때 Agent 객체가 불필요하게 여러 번 생성되는 것을 방지하여 성능을 최적화하기 위해, 일반 Python 함수 스코프 또는 전역 변수를 활용하여 객체를 한 번만 생성하고 재사용하는 기법입니다.\n","*   **`gr.ChatInterface`의 `fn` 인자**: `gr.ChatInterface`를 사용할 때, 사용자가 메시지를 입력하고 제출할 때 호출될 Python 함수를 지정합니다. 이 함수는 사용자 메시지와 현재 대화 기록을 인자로 받고, 업데이트된 대화 기록을 반환해야 합니다.\n","*   **`agent.invoke()`**: LangChain Agent Executor 객체의 메서드입니다. 사용자 입력(프롬프트)을 인자로 받아 Agent의 실행을 시작하고, Agent가 작업을 완료한 후 최종 결과(답변, 중간 단계 등)를 반환합니다. Gradio 앱에서는 사용자 입력이 발생했을 때 `fn`에 연결된 함수 내에서 이 메서드를 호출하여 Agent의 답변을 얻습니다.\n","*   **`result['output']`**: `agent.invoke()` 호출 결과로 반환되는 딕셔너리에서 Agent의 최종 답변 텍스트를 포함하는 키입니다. 이 값을 추출하여 챗봇 응답으로 사용자에게 표시합니다.\n","\n","### 과제 진행 방식\n","\n","1.  **Agent 코드 준비:** 이전 차시에서 완성한 '민원 해결사 Agent'의 Python 코드가 `cs_agent.py` 파일로 저장되어 있는지 확인합니다. 이 파일에는 `CustomerServiceAgent` 클래스가 포함되어 있어야 합니다.\n","2.  **`app.py`에 Agent 클래스 import:** `app.py` 파일 상단에 `from cs_agent import CustomerServiceAgent`와 같이 Agent 클래스를 import 하는 코드를 `TODO 1` 위치에 작성합니다.\n","3.  **Python 함수 내에서 Agent 객체 캐싱 구현:** `CustomerServiceAgent` 클래스의 인스턴스를 생성하고 반환하는 함수(`get_agent_instance`)를 정의합니다. 이 함수는 전역 변수 등을 활용하여 Agent 인스턴스가 이미 생성되었는지 확인하고, 생성되지 않았다면 새로 만들고 저장한 후 반환하도록 구현합니다. 이 코드를 `TODO 2` 위치에 완성합니다.\n","4.  **`gr.ChatInterface`의 `fn` 함수 수정:** 과제 1에서 작성한 `respond` 함수를 수정하여, 사용자 입력(`message`)이 발생했을 때 `get_agent_instance()`를 호출하여 Agent 객체를 가져오고, `agent.invoke({\"input\": message})`를 호출하여 Agent의 응답(`result`)을 받습니다. 이 코드를 `TODO 3` 위치에 작성합니다.\n","5.  **Agent 응답을 대화 기록에 추가:** `agent.invoke()` 호출 결과에서 최종 답변(`result['output']`)을 추출하여, Gradio의 `history` 형식([user_message, bot_message] 쌍의 리스트)에 맞게 새로운 메시지 쌍을 추가하고 업데이트된 `history`를 반환하는 코드를 `TODO 4` 위치에 완성합니다."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"OpEAmt7ioz8h"},"source":["#### `reward_policy.txt` 파일 준비\n","\n","YES24의 정책에 관한 PDF 문서에서 보상 정책만을 텍스트로 추출합니다."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"1m_KlinDrWn8"},"outputs":[],"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Lo2JS6OUouU1","outputId":"dbdd90a0-709f-438b-cf00-5155c68554b7"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["--- './' 경로에서 찾은 PDF 파일 목록: [] ---\n","An error occurred while loading ./shipping_policy.txt: Error loading ./shipping_policy.txt\n","\n","--- 모든 파일에서 로드된 총 문서 정보 ---\n","총 문서 개수: 0\n","로드된 문서가 없습니다.\n","--------------------\n"]}],"source":["import glob #

ReAct 프레임워크의 '생각(Thought)과 행동(Action)' 과정을 시각적으로 표시하여 Agent의 투명성과 신뢰도를 높입니다.\n","\n","### 학습 키워드 설명\n","\n","*   **`Reasoning`**: Agent가 사용자의 입력을 이해하고, 어떤 도구를 어떤 순서로 사용하여 문제를 해결할지 추론하는 과정입니다. LangChain의 ReAct Agent에서는 이 과정이 'Thought' 단계로 표현되며, Agent의 상세 로그(`verbose=True`)에 기록됩니다.\n","*   **`gr.Blocks`**: Gradio에서 여러 컴포넌트를 조합하여 복잡한 레이아웃과 상호작용을 정의할 수 있는 저수준 API입니다. `gr.ChatInterface`는 미리 정의된 레이아웃만 제공하지만, `gr.Blocks`를 사용하면 챗봇 외에 Agent 생각 과정, JSON 출력 등을 표시할 별도의 컴포넌트를 자유롭게 배치할 수 있습니다.\n","*   **`gr.Textbox` (for display)**: 사용자 입력뿐만 아니라 텍스트 정보를 출력하는 용도로도 사용됩니다. Agent의 중간 생각 과정(Thought, Action, Observation)을 파싱하여 보기 쉬운 텍스트 형태로 만들어 이 컴포넌트에 표시합니다. `interactive=False`로 설정하여 사용자 입력을 방지합니다.\n","*   **`gr.JSON`**: Python 딕셔너리나 리스트 형태의 데이터를 구조화되고 읽기 쉬운 JSON 형식으로 화면에 표시하는 Gradio 컴포넌트입니다. Agent의 최종 출력이 JSON 형식일 경우 이를 사용자에게 명확하게 보여주는 데 사용합니다.\n","*   **`yield` (in Gradio functions)**: Gradio 함수에서 `yield` 키워드를 사용하면 함수의 실행 중간에 UI를 업데이트할 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 Agent가 Think, Act, Observe 단계를 거칠 때마다 중간 과정을 실시간 또는 단계별로 사용자에게 보여주는 것처럼 구현할 수 있습니다. (Agent Executor의 `invoke`는 기본적으로 동기 호출이므로, 실제 구현에서는 `yield`를 사용하여 최종 결과를 포함한 모든 컴포넌트 상태를 한 번에 업데이트하는 방식을 사용할 수 있습니다.)\n","*   **이벤트 핸들링 (`.click()`, `.submit()`)**: Gradio에서 버튼 클릭(`.click()`)이나 텍스트 입력 후 Enter 키 누름(`.submit()`)과 같은 사용자 인터랙션에 특정 Python 함수를 연결하는 방법입니다. `gr.Blocks`를 사용할 때 사용자 입력창(`gr.Textbox`) 또는 제출 버튼(`gr.Button`)에 `process_message`와 같은 Agent 호출 및 UI 업데이트 함수를 연결하는 데 사용합니다.\n","\n","\n","### 과제 진행 방식\n","\n","1.  **`app.py`에 필요한 라이브러리 import:** `app.py` 파일 상단에 `import json`과 `import re`를 추가합니다.\n","2.  **`gr.Blocks`로 UI 구조 변경:** `gr.ChatInterface` 대신 `with gr.Blocks(...) as demo:` 구문을 사용하여 전체 UI 레이아웃을 정의합니다. 챗봇 (`gr.Chatbot`), 사용자 입력창 (`gr.Textbox`), 제출 버튼 (`gr.Button`) 외에 Agent 생각 과정을 표시할 `gr.Textbox` (`intermediate_steps_display`)와 JSON 출력을 표시할 `gr.JSON` (`json_output_display`) 컴포넌트를 추가합니다. `gr.Row`와 `gr.Column`을 사용하여 컴포넌트들을 원하는 위치에 배치합니다. 이 코드를 `TODO 2` 위치에 작성합니다.\n","3.  **Agent 호출 함수 수정 및 `yield` 활용:** 실습 2에서 작성한 `respond` 함수를 수정하거나 (또는 `gr.Blocks`에 맞게 새로운 함수 `process_message`를 정의하여), Agent 호출 전/후 및 중간 과정(가능하다면)에 `yield`를 사용하여 UI 컴포넌트의 상태를 업데이트합니다. 특히, Agent 실행 시작 시 로딩 상태를 표시하고, 실행 완료 후에는 최종 응답, 중간 단계 로그, JSON 출력 컴포넌트의 상태를 업데이트하도록 구현합니다. 이 코드를 `TODO 1`, `TODO 3`, `TODO 4`, `TODO 5` 위치에 걸쳐 완성합니다.\n","4.  **Agent 중간 생각 과정 파싱 및 `gr.Textbox` 업데이트:** Agent의 `invoke` 결과(`result`)에 포함된 `intermediate_steps`를 순회하며 각 단계(Thought, Action, Observation)를 추출하고 보기 좋게 텍스트로 조합합니다. 이 텍스트를 `intermediate_steps_display` 컴포넌트의 값으로 설정하여 `yield` 또는 반환 값에 포함시킵니다. 이 코드를 `TODO 4` 위치에 완성합니다.\n","5.  **Agent 최종 출력 JSON 처리 및 `gr.JSON` 업데이트:** Agent의 최종 응답 문자열(`result['output']`)이 JSON 형식인지 확인합니다. JSON 형식이라면 `json.loads()`로 파싱하고 `json_output_display` 컴포넌트의 값으로 설정하며 `visible=True`로 업데이트합니다. JSON 형식이 아니라면 `json_output_display`를 숨기거나(visible=False) 값을 None으로 설정합니다. 이 로직을 `TODO 5` 위치에 완성합니다.\n","6.  **이벤트 핸들러 연결:** `gr.Blocks` 내에서 사용자 입력창(`textbox`)의 `submit` 이벤트와 제출 버튼(`submit_btn`)의 `click` 이벤트를 Agent 호출 및 UI 업데이트를 담당하는 함수(`process_message`)에 연결합니다. 입력 컴포넌트와 출력 컴포넌트를 명시적으로 지정합니다.\n","\n","### 과제 3 코드"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"id":"a261dc26","outputId":"23846c4c-eab6-4bed-c7ac-b254068fc08e"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Colab notebook detected.
